Most websites fail at the same steps: unclear value proposition, weak proof, and slow paths to action. You can spot all three in minutes.

## Quick audit steps

1. Ask three people to read your homepage for 10 seconds. Can they explain what you do?
2. Check mobile speed and the first paint time. If it feels slow, it is.
3. Count how many clicks it takes to book a call.
4. Replace generic testimonials with results and specific outcomes.
5. Make the primary CTA the only high-contrast button on the page.

If you want the full conversion teardown, schedule a consult and I will map the fixes to your site.
