When teams ask for AI training, what they usually want is speed and confidence. But what they need is a safe way to change how work gets done. That means picking real tasks, not toy examples.

## The three signals that you are ready

1. You can name two repetitive tasks that consume 5+ hours per week.
2. Your team already has a shared system for capturing prompts, templates, or process notes.
3. You have a leader who will sponsor the new workflow after the workshop ends.

## What we build in the room

We start with a short audit, then we pick one workflow that matters. The workshop ends with a working prompt library, a clear review loop, and a simple measurement plan so you can prove the ROI.

If you want to see what this looks like for your team, schedule a consult and I will map the workshop to your exact roles.
