Local SEO works best when your site, Google Business Profile, and review strategy all tell the same story. The most common wins are simple, but they are rarely done consistently.

## The five upgrades that matter first

- Align your homepage title tag with the exact service + location your customers search.
- Add a dedicated service page for each core offer, not one catch-all list.
- Make your phone number and service area visible above the fold on mobile.
- Use FAQ sections that answer the same questions you get on calls.
- Ask for reviews right after delivery, with a direct link and a short prompt.

If you want a custom audit, book a consult and I will send you a prioritized list.
